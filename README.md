# BU HMS Study

Healthy Minds Study is an annual web-based survey study examining mental health, service utilization, and related issues among BU students.

This project has a special emphasis on understanding service utilization and help-seeking behaviors, including factors such as stigma, knowledge, and the role of peers and other potential gatekeepers.
